							<strong>Mœbius</strong> (Jean Giraud)
						</a>
						was born in Nogent-sur-Marne, Val-de-Marne, in the suburbs of Paris,
						on 8 May 1938. <br /> In 1954 at age 16, he began his only technical training at the
						<a href="https://duperre.org/" target="_blank"> École Supérieure des Arts Appliqués Duperré </a>, where he,
						unsurprisingly, started producing Western comics, which however did not sit well with his teachers.

							alt="western comic by artist Giraud" />
					</a>
					<p>
						At 18, Giraud was drawing his own comic Western strip, "Frank et Jeremie", for the magazine "Far West", his
						very first commercial sale. From <strong>1956 to 1958</strong> he published Western comics, alongside
						several others of a French historical nature, in the magazines "Fripounet et Marisette", "Coeurs Valiants"
						and "Ames Valliantes" – all from catholic publisher Fleurus, and all of them of a strong edifying nature
						aimed at France's adolescent youth – , among them a strip called <strong>"King of the Buffalo"</strong>, and
						another called <strong>"A Giant with the Hurons".</strong> It was for Fleurus that Giraud also illustrated
						his first three books. Already in this period his style was heavily influenced by his later mentor,
						<a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/j/jije.htm" target="_blank">
							<strong>Joseph "Jijé" Gillain</strong>.
						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1961, returning from military service, Giraud became an apprentice of Jijé, who was one of the leading
						comic artists in Europe of the time. In his period, Jijé used Giraud as his assistant on an album of his
						Western series Jerry Spring, <strong>"The Road to Coronado"</strong>, which Giraud inked.

						<strong>Arzach</strong></a> is a wordless comic, created in a conscious attempt to breathe new life into
					the comic genre which at the time was dominated by American superhero comics. It tracks the journey of the
					title character flying on the back of his pterodactyl through a fantastic world mixing medieval fantasy with
					futurism.<br />Unlike most science fiction comics, it has no captions, no speech balloons and no written sound
					effects. It has been argued that the wordlessness provides the strip with a sense of timelessness, setting up
					Arzach's journey as a quest for eternal, universal truths.
